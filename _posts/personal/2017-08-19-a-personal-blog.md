I've been thinking of making a personal blog for a while in addition to my technical blog. I want to be able to write about things I care about which aren't technical so I created this section. It's not in my regular RSS feed as the thoughts and opinions I want to share here are personal reflections rather than technical information.

I am a Christian, a husband, a father and a geek. 

One of the things I particularly enjoy is learning about science and the universe we live in. I find our universe absolutely fascinating especially the scale and complexity produced by some relatively simple rules. Its amazing the scale of not only the observable universe but the possibly infinite space that it exists within. We have learnt so much especially in the last hundred years and I cant wait to see what else we will discover over the course of my lifetime.

In my lifetime we may well have the first humans on another planet (spaceX), send our first probes to other stars (starshot) and see amazing new images of the universe and nearby exoplanets (James Webb). Im super excited to see what the future will revel.
